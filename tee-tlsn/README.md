# Freysa TLSNotary

Freysa TLSNotary is a protocol that allows user to get their internet TLS data attested by a notary server.
To respect user privacy, notary server is supposed to run in a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).

## Note
Note: This is a fork of the [TLSNotary project](https://tlsnotary.org) with important changes, namely:
- The MPC scheme is discarded.
- The notary lives instead in a TEE to provide privacy guarantees.

This repository contains various crates, the most important ones are:

- [notary](./crates/notary/): Implements the notary server
- [wasm](./crates/verifier/): Implements the client component, has to be compiled to WASM


## Run notary locally

```
cd crates/notary/server
cargo run
```

### Run with docker

The dockerfile expect a 'tls' folder with TLS certificates at the root of the repository.
You can rename 'tls-example' to 'tls' for testing purposes.

```
cp ../providers.json ./providers.json
docker build --build-arg CONFIG_FILE=config_prod.yaml -t notary-test .
docker run -p 7047:7047  notary-test
```

## Notary config file 

The notary config file allows you to set the list of providers (websites), TL, and also the port of the notary server.

See [config.yaml](./crates/notary/server/config/config.yaml) file.
 

## Deploy notary server on TEE

See [DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md) for deployment instructions.

## Build WASM for chrome extension

```
cd crates/wasm
./build.sh
```

Then move the output to tee-tlsn-js/wasm/pkg

## Run websockify server

The extension needs to go through to a websockify server to exchange data with the notary server.

 (TBD)

```
docker build -t websockify .
docker run -p 55688:55688 websockify
```

## Development


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note on Rust-to-WASM Compilation**: This project requires compiling Rust into WASM, which needs [`clang`](https://clang.llvm.org/) version 16.0.0 or newer. MacOS users, be aware that Xcode's default `clang` might be older. If you encounter the error `No available targets are compatible with triple "wasm32-unknown-unknown"`, it's likely due to an outdated `clang`. Updating `clang` to a newer version should resolve this issue.
> 
> For MacOS aarch64 users, if Apple's default `clang` isn't working, try installing `llvm` via Homebrew (`brew install llvm`). You can then prioritize the Homebrew `clang` over the default macOS version by modifying your `PATH`. Add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):
> ```sh
> export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"
> ```

If you run into this error:
```
Could not find directory of OpenSSL installation, and this `-sys` crate cannot
  proceed without this knowledge. If OpenSSL is installed and this crate had
  trouble finding it,  you can set the `OPENSSL_DIR` environment variable for the
  compilation process.
```
Make sure you have the development packages of OpenSSL installed (`libssl-dev` on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` on Fedora).


## Deployed Notary Servers

Note: we do not provide any guarantees on the stability of the notary server in its current state 
This is an experimental project.

## Deployed Websocket servers

## Providers

A provider configuration is a JSON object describing a web request,  what and how to extract data from the response.
See [config.yaml](./crates/notary/server/config/config.yaml) to find the link to default provider list and provider schema.
